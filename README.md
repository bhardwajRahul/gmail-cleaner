## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- ✅ **100% Local** - No external servers, no data collection
- ✅ **Open Source** - Inspect all the code yourself
- ✅ **Minimal Permissions** - Only requests read + modify (for mark as read)
- ✅ **Your Credentials** - You control your own Google OAuth app
- ✅ **Gitignored Secrets** - `credentials.json` and `token.json` never get committed

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Why do I need to create my own Google Cloud project?**
> Because this app accesses your Gmail. By using your own OAuth credentials, you have full control and don't need to trust a third party.

**Q: Is this safe?**
> Yes! The code is open source - you can inspect it. Your emails are processed locally on your machine.

**Q: Can I use this for multiple Gmail accounts?**
> Yes! Click "Sign Out" and sign in with a different account. Each account needs to be added as a test user in your Google Cloud project.

**Q: Emails went to Trash, can I recover them?**
> Yes! The delete feature moves emails to Trash. Go to Gmail → Trash to recover within 30 days.
